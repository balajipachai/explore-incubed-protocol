# User Interface

1. The main objective of this bare minimum user interface is to get inputs from the front-end, send to the server, and get a response.

2. Thus, I have not given much importance to say the look and feel, instead I have focussed on ensuring that the intended flow works as expected.

3. Also 2-way binding has been used instead of forms, the idea was to get the functionality working.

4. I agree there are scope for improvements, certainly there are but given the need of the hour I have focussed on the need part and the want part.

5. As 2 - way binding has been used extensively, thus, defined the variable just above the function declaration, for quick reference
